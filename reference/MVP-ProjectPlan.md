## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

### ✅ **What's Already Complete** 
- **Schema:** Clean 5-table structure (users, events, event_participants, media, messages)
- **Authentication:** Phone-first OTP with development mode support
- **Core UI:** Next.js App Router with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript integration with auto-generated Supabase types
- **RLS Security:** Row Level Security properly implemented for all tables
- **Basic Flows:** Landing page, authentication, event selection, basic dashboard

### ⚠️ **Gaps Identified**
- Media upload functionality incomplete
- Real-time messaging needs WebSocket integration
- Guest import CSV processing needs refinement
- Missing performance indexes on high-traffic columns
- Error boundaries need enhancement for production

- [x] ✅ Confirm all RLS policies and functions reference correct tables
- [x] ✅ Validate TypeScript types are current
- [x] 🔧 Add missing performance indexes: // ✅ Applied 6 performance indexes via MCP migration
  ```sql
  -- High-traffic query optimizations - COMPLETED
  ✅ idx_messages_event_created ON messages (event_id, created_at DESC);
  ✅ idx_media_event_created ON media (event_id, created_at DESC);
  ✅ idx_event_participants_user_role ON event_participants (user_id, role);
  ✅ idx_events_host_date ON events (host_user_id, event_date DESC);
  ✅ idx_event_participants_event_status ON event_participants (event_id, rsvp_status);
